Yelp Data Subset Recommender System: May 20, 2021 - May 27, 2021


<ul>

<li> Utilized Natural Language Processing’s Sentiment Analysis to create numeric value, which I call a reviewscore, to represent the ratio of positive sentiment words to the sum of positive and negative sentiment words. </li>

<li> Averaged the aforementioned review score with the numeric rating given directly by a user to create aquantity, which I call a sentiment score and incorporated said quantity into a user based collaborative filtering recommender system as a basis for determining the set of recommendations that a user will receive. </li>

<li> Created an R Shiny web application that incorporates this combination of Sentiment Analysis and User Based Collaborative Filtering to allow users outside of the Yelp dataset to make reviews and ratings for Yelp businesses in the subset in order to receive recommendations based on their own preferences. The web application can be accessed from this [link](https://josephheadley.shinyapps.io/deliverables/). </li>
